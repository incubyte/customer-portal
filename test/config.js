Here is the test code for the security issue in the provided code:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(expressSession({ secret: 'test-secret' }));

describe('GET /example', () => {
  it('should return "I\'m in danger!"', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .get('/example')
      .expect(200);

    expect(res.text).toBe("I'm in danger!");
  });
});
```

This test code uses the `supertest` library to send a GET request to the `/example` endpoint and expects a response with a status code of 200 and the text "I'm in danger!". It also sets a custom secret for the session cookie to address the security issue mentioned in the code.
